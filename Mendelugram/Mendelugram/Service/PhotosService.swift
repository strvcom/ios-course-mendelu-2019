Where text is visible in a document, people tend to focus on the textual content rather than upon overall presentation, so publishers use lorem ipsum when displaying a typeface or design in order to direct the focus to presentation. \"Lorem ipsum\" also approximates a typical distribution of letters in English.", author: oprah)
